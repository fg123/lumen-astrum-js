# Tutorial
## Welcome to Lumen Astrum!

Lumen Astrum is a turn based strategy game where your goal is to expand your territory and defeat your enemies.
You win the game by expanding your territory to the point where the bar on the top right wins.
Your opponents will be trying to do the same.


## Phases

The turns in Lumen are seperated into two phases:
* Planning Phase
* Action Phase

During the Planning Phase, you can send orders to your units and buildings, such as moving, attacking, constructing buildings or spawning units. 

During the Action phase, the your orders will be carried out. Units will move and fight during this time. You cannot send orders during the Action Phase.

You can see how long each phase will last with the green bar at the top.

The planning phase lasts 20 seconds, and the action phase lasts 10 seconds.

## Spawning Units

To spawn a unit:
1. Click on the building that the unit spawns from. 
2. Click on the unit that you want to spawn on the menu on the bottom left.
3. Click on where you want that unit to spawn. You must spawn units directly beside the building that they spawn from.

At your home base, you can spawn two units: 
* Engineers
* Scouts

Engineers can construct buildings.
Scouts can explore. 

At the barracks, you can spawn three units:
* Marines
* Golems
* Reavers

Marines are ranged combat units.
Golems are slow melee combat units.
Reavers are units that explode when they die, dealing damage to nearby enemies. 

## Movement and Combat

To move a unit:
1. Click on the unit.
2. Hold down G or right click on where you want the unit to go.

Holding down G also shows you the range of how far the unit can travel of there are no buildings or other units in the way.

Units will automatically fight whatever enemy unit or building is in range.

## Constructing Buildings

Building can be built from the engineer:
1. Click on the engineer.
2. Click on the building that you want to construct on the menu on the bottom left.
3. Click on where you want that building to spawn. You must construct buildings directly beside the engineer.

Units cannot move through buildings, so think carefully before you put you buildings down!

## Territory and Income

You can expand territory by constructing Deployment Outposts from your engineer. The territory you will gain is outlined in white by where you hover over with the Deployment Outpost.

If a Ether Harvester is inside your territory, you get extra gold every turn.

Gem harvesters can be attacked, and whoever destroys the harvester with the last hit gains control of it. Control of the harvester will change every time the health bar is depleted by whoever gets the last hit.

## Upgrades

You can upgrade units by building upgrades at the barracks and home base.

Upgrades only affect new units that are created after the upgrade building is done building. 

Upgrades at the home base affect all units.

Upgrades at the barracks only affects units the spawn from that barracks.

## Turrets

Turrets are defensive combat structures that have a high range. THey can only be built by an engineer after an automation factory has been built.

## Chat Surrendering

You can surrender by typing "/ff" in chat.
